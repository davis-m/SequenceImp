13-095:
310113: Continued work on improving feedback provided by the pipeline.
210213: Improved documentation.
210213: More typos.
040413: Change headers to miRNA expression table - to be more intuitive.
040413: Introduced large changes to the way that miRNA counts are handled. These include:
            The option to consider each miRNA locus individually as well as merge them based on miRNA ID.
            The option to distribute multi-mapping reads between miRNA loci by a method that considers the distribution
               of uniquely mapping reads. This method no longer considers alignments not associated with miRNA annotation.
            Different methods to handle overlapping miRNA annotations from miRBase.
040413: Update to all Default Configuration files to reflect the new options available for handling miRNA expression matrices.
050413: Further improved documentation to explain new methods for handling miRNA expression counts in more detail.
050413: Added references to manual and --system-check option.

13-274:
250713: Added checks to return helpful error messages.
090913: Identified a problem with an R package inconsistently parsing command line flags between versions.
        Altered pipeline to ensure consistent behaviour with all R versions.
130913: Pipeline quits with non-zero exit code when threads fail.

13-354:
291113: Edited reaper default configurations to increase the stringencies on sequence searches to help prevent spurious matches.
021213: Corrected typos and implemented some spelling variations in options.

14-224:
150714: Changes to pipeline to make it compatible with the new annotation
        system - unfortunately this will supersede older versions of the annotation and
        the pipeline will be incompatible with previous annotation releases due to
        changes in annotation filenames and organisation. This will however allow the
        user greater flexibility in the construction of annotation sets to be used with
         the pipeline.

            align step feature comparison plots adjusted to allow the pipeline to cope with annotation sets that could
               have a varying number of classes. Therefore, two plots from the same lane will not necessarily display the same
               annotation classes in the same order.
               In addition, annotation classes represented by a small number of reads are collapsed to 
               a "Remaining" annotation category.
            repversion option added to the features section of the config file. This will allow flexibility in the selection 
               of user defined annotation datasets for each stage of the pipeline.

170714: collapse_method option added to the features section of the configuration file. 
        This option will allow the miRNA counts to be merged either based on miRBase ID (old method) or mature sequence.
210714: align step plots were altered to allow the pipeline to skip plots intended to compare reads to repeat annotation, where
            this annotation is not available.

14-246:
010914: Defined the precision at which weights are applied to repeat coverage for repeat mapping reads. At extremely high precision (eg. 10^-7)
            bases with no coverage were receiving low counts (eg. 5 x 10^17), using the GenomicRanges coverage() function.
        Corrected problem that caused repeat step to crash if only overlaps of a single length were identified.            
030914: Ensured that when comparisons are made against repeat elements, the pipeline does not crash if no alignments are identified, due to Samtools
            truncated file error message.
        Repeat element length plot will include points to allow visualisation of read sets of a single length.

15-075:
130315: Solve issue concerning default collapse_method not being accepted by the pipeline
        Remove underscores from R options as these are not interpreted correctly in some R versions
160315: Updated README.

15-127:
050315: Fix Bowtie alignment plots for cases where either no repeat or gene annotation classes do surpass the threshold to plot
            as individual classes rather than as a combined set.

041016: Updated pipeline to work with the latest samtools versions. Include version check as some alterations to samtools sort are 
not compatible with earlier samtools versions.

17-053:
220217: Edited trimming configuration to anchor -3p-prefix.
        Fix bug in paired end read IDs. Edit the read names in paired end clean-up to ensure paired reads have matching IDs.
        Add add_read_index.pl to add a pair index to paired end read IDs.
        Begin implementing more streamlined testing to ease continued development (t/). Add streamlined paired end testing.

17-055:
220217: Incorporate changes from tleonardi to fix bug that causes a crash when the vast majority of reads align to a single Ensembl category (issue #1).

17-087:
280217: Update to the documentation.
